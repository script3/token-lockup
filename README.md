# soroban-token-lockup

Lockup contract for any SEP-0041 compatible token. The lockup functionality is defined by a series of unlocks and the percent of total tokens that can be claimed at each lockup. These can be used as vesting contracts by retaining the admin role, or into lockup contracts by revoking it.
